# Backend Engineer Coding Challenge

This project involves building RESTful web APIs that can understand text inputs and trigger predefined workflows.

## Task Overview

Your task is to build RESTful web APIs that process text inputs and trigger predefined workflows. The workflows include the following:

- **Invoice Status Enquiry**: Should return the correct status of the invoice (Paid, Pending, Overdue).
- **New Invoice Submission**: Adds a new invoice to the storage (line items and the due date can be empty).
- **Client Information Enquiry**: Should return the correct company information.

### Data Sources

These are the seed data sources and can be served using a solution of your choice (API, database, in-memory storage):

- **Invoices Data**: [invoices-attelas.json](https://github.com/attelas-ai/Take-home-test-backend/blob/main/invoices-attelas.json)
- **Clients Data**: [clients-attelas.json](https://github.com/attelas-ai/Take-home-test-backend/blob/main/clients-attelas.json)

### Sample Text Inputs

- **Test Data**: [testdata-attelas.json](https://github.com/attelas-ai/Take-home-test-backend/blob/main/testdata-attelas.json)

## Things We Value

- Clean and well-structured code
- Testing

## Stretch Goals

- Containerise the application
- Add security measures and authentication
- Be creative! Try to extend additional workflows or implement interesting functionalities using LLMs in the accounting/finance space (you can take inspiration from some use cases at [Attelas.ai](https://attelas.ai)).

## Submission

Please submit a link to a GitHub repository with your solution, including a brief `README.md` file explaining how to run the project.
